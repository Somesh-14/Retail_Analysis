# Retail Data Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of retail data, comparing two approaches: one utilizing the optimization library *FireDucks* and another following a traditional data analysis method. The study examines performance differences in processing a *500,000-record dataset, which is scaled up to **32 million records* to assess efficiency and scalability.

## Objectives
- *Performance Comparison:* Evaluate processing speed and resource utilization with and without FireDucks.
- *Scalability Testing:* Analyze how increasing data volume affects processing performance.
- *Methodology Insights:* Understand the advantages and limitations of using optimization libraries in retail data analysis.

## Dataset Information
- *Initial Dataset:* 500,000 retail transactions.
- *Expanded Dataset:* Scaled up by a factor of *60* to create a *32 million-record dataset*.
- *Time-based Evaluations:* Processing times are measured across different data volumes to compare efficiency.
